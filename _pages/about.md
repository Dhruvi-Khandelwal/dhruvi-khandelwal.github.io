I am an upcoming Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee. My research group will focus on addressing probabilistic challenges in electrical energy grids. In addition, we will explore the potential of quantum computing to solve various computational problems, both within the power grid and in broader energineering applications.


Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Advanced Network Science Initiative (ANSI), Applied Mathematics Division (T-5), Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA. I collaborate closely with [Sidhant Misra](https://sidhantmisra.github.io) and [Deepjyoti Deka](https://www.linkedin.com/in/deepjyoti-deka-8a44388/) on developing applied machine learning tool for power grids and networked systems. I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, advised by of [Hung D. Nguyen](https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?hl=en&user=jG-MRH8AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate). Prior to NTU, I earned my M.Tech in Energy Studies from the Department of Energy Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD), where I worked with [Ashu Verma](https://abudhabi.iitd.ac.in/averma). My group's research focuses are on 

**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Learning-Integrated Power System Operations:</span>** The group's research will focus on developing **physics-inspired methodologies** that leverage **machine learning (ML)** to optimize and secure power system operations and planning. We aim to enhance the **reliability**, **efficiency**, and **resilience** of energy networks operating under uncertainty by developing **problem-specific ML tools**. 


**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Probabilistic and Non-Parametric Methods:</span>** Group will focus on advancing probabilistic methods and non-parametric techniques to create robust and interpretable models for **Medium to Long Term Planning** & **Cause-Effect Studies** in renewable energy-dominated Indian power grids. By addressing the complexities introduced by renewable integration, we aim to enhance grid reliability and operational efficiency.


**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Quantum Computing Potential Exploration:</span>** Group will **investigate the capabilities of**quantum computing in solving computationally combursome problems in grids & other engineering domains.  The aim will be to scrutinizing and advance the boundaries of what's possible using Quantum computing for **Our Favourite Problems**.
