I am an upcoming Assistant Professor at Department of Electrical Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee.

Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Advanced Network Science Initiative (ANSI), Applied Mathematics Division, Los Alamos National Laboratory, USA. I collaborate closely with Deepjyoti Deka, Sidhant Misra on cutting-edge research in power systems and network science.I completed my Ph.D. at the School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Nanyang Technological University Singapore, under the supervision of Hung D. Nguyen. Prior to NTU, I earned my M.Tech in Energy Studies from the Department of Energy Science and Engineering at the Indian Institute of Technology Delhi (IITD), where I worked with Ashu Verma. My research focuses are on 

**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Learning-Integrated Power System Operations:</span>** I work on advanced methodologies that integrate machine learning into power system operations to enhance the reliability and efficiency of energy networks under uncertainty. My special focus is on Bayesian learning for power systems.

**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Quantum Computing for Energy Systems:</span>** This research direction is about exploring the potential of quantum computing in solving complex optimization problems in power systems, pushing (and checking) the boundaries of what's possible in energy analytics.

**<span style="color: #ff6600;">Probabilistic and Non-Parametric Methods:</span>** I work on probabilistic methods and non-parametric techniques to develop robust, interpretable models for optimal power flow and stability analysis in power grids dominated by renewable energy.
