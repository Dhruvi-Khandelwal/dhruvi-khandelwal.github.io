**For Prospective Students:** I am currently seeking PhD candidates for Spring 2025 through the Electrical Engineering admission process at IIT Roorkee. Please refer to the application guidelines available [here](https://iitr.ac.in/Academics/Admission%20To%20Doctoral%20Programmes.html). 

I encourage applicants with backgrounds in electrical engineering, operations research, and applied machine learning to apply. I am particularly interested in students who are eager to develop expertise to address complex challenges in power engineering via $$\large Power+AI$$ route. In my experience, it is often more effective to teach the specifics of power engineering to individuals with strong mathematical, computational, or operational research backgrounds than vice versa.

Please feel free to email me at [here](mailto:pareek@lanl.gov) with the subject line “Propective Masters/Doctoral Student Application Spring 2025 - [Your Name]”, including a brief overview of your interests and how you would contribute to our research group. Try and review a few of the resources given below before writing to me. Attach your CV and any other relevant documents. If you do not receive a response, please do not hesitate to follow up.

**Some Relevent Resources:** 


- Seminar Series : [enOPTIMAL](https://wdvorkin.github.io/enoptimal/), [DTU PES Summer School](https://www.youtube.com/@dtulecturesonpowerenergysy8133/videos), ...
